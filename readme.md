## Readme for the Json-2-Html parser

The following code is a training project I did for a company in Maribor. As somebody who didn't have any prior experience in Java it was a really interesting experience, as I had to learn a new programming language and solve an algorithmic issue.

The switch of paradigms from functional to object oriented took some time to get used to but at the end I managed to produce a good result. At the heart of the app is the tagWriter.java which writes the HTML tags recursively. The code also features custom classes as the main objects that make this code OOP.
